Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box.

Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3.

The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***"

I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box. Running Smooth.***Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...***1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal***Worst camera and ear piece is really horrible.. There is no Samsung pay also.. Honestly the worst phone to buy***"

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6.

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

I like the display a lot.

Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it😊***Good phone.

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

But my opinion is they are expecting the performance of a iPhone in this mobile(brainless people) . You paid only 5k and expecting 50k experience this is bullshit. Now let me come to the review part. This mobile is good value for money.battery is too good. Performance is decent for a 5k mobile. And the overall performance is good. Camera is not that good. Fingerprint sensor works nicely. Build quality is decent. Speaker is too good. This is my honest review.***Nice but screen***The phone is worth the money. Good performance, the camera quality is average(which doesn't bother me as I don't use it much). The battery life is incredible on a normal use it stands two days. The heating problem written in other comments does not happen while using the phone , except while using it while charging , which is not suitable for any phone's life. The packaging was good and delivered before date. Altogether its worth the money at this price range***Very wrost mobile. From the 1st day itself its not working properly. Not even a proper support from amazon service. Smartcheck app shows that there is no problem in the phone but the performance of the phone is very wrost. Touch is not properly working. Hanging, heating, speakers are not even good. Very very worst mobile. Please don’t buy this***Mobile is too poor quality its getting too heated while on calling n while chargingI want to return it back***"

Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space.Phone is quite light weight and very smart.

Though cassual games will be ok.▶ Already using 2 of 16 gb versions, my suggestion will be to get 32 gb internal, as sooner or later 16 gb runs out of space and you need to uninstall things to install others. Current apps n content consume a lot of space.▶ Even after launch of Redmi 7 series, 6A is still in shelves for a reason. It offers quice decent feature set & performance in its price bracket. None of the current devices can beat its price point. Available frequently on sale for 500 less.▶ BUT be open to other options available out there, you may shell out few bucks extra to avoid cons.***"

Yet another great product from Nokia.Thanks for the ontime delivery too.***Sound quality: Good. Battery life: maximum 40 hours with internet or wifi ON. Durability: no comments, it's Nokia for God's sake.In few words, this phone is best for people who don't play HD games or use their phones for excessive photo capturing. Rest, this phone provides all the functionality of voice and best quality video calling via Duo, WhatsApp, Telegram, FB messenger. digital payment options with GooglePay and Paytm. Online entertainment with YouTube Go, JioCinema( login with Jio credentials mandatory), Transportation with OLA lite and Google Maps go. Thank God there's no inbuilt browser except Google chrome which we can disable or best - uninstall and replace with the Lite version of any browser we like. Of course, you cannot expect a 1 GB RAM phone to honor your 64 MB browser requirements alongside 3 other apps in multitasking mode which itself use 10- 30 MB of RAM.For phone security, it gives 3 universal options- PIN, Pattern and Password.Oh and 1 more thing I have also installed candy crush saga on this phone which works absolutely fine without any crash or hanging issues while chatting on Telegram.I don't think anyone with medium essential requirements of a phone shouldn't purchase this phone.***It's a smart, bright-coloured handy phone suitable for elderly people and those graduating from feature+keypad phones to smart+touchphones. It's 1GB RAM is slow and steady and average touchscreen experience makes it easy for newbies. Poor battery standby and low quality screen resolution, considering they have thought of a functional Oreo OS variant but compromised on these hardware. Bare minimum internal storage of just 8GB, of which we get a little below 4GB free to use as the rest is taken by the system OS. All in all, a laboured purchase decision, given the compact screen size, price point and keeping other budget requirements in mind. I bought it for my mom so that she can use a Jio 4G SIM. While all other brands are moving to a somewhat eco-friendly all-glass body this handset is a polycarbonate one, at that. And, by the way, I have stuck a tempered glass protector as this handset's facia has no known protective shield. Lastly ,I have added a photo of the handset as proof of purchase, as requested for Amazon reviews. You can, in fact, see my silhouette on the screen!***Overall phone is gooood at this price.the phone is go edition therefore it has only go apps preinstalled.but u can install apps as u like.1.Some apps on playstore are not running on this phone.2.This phone is sutaible for elders but not for young people coz no high quality games are run due to 1gb ram.3.Last main thing is that the phone has vga screen and has less pixels.so it is not sutaible for viewing movies.4. 5mp camera and 2mp front are average.5.Battery backup is very nice.6.speker is very loud.thats a better.Overall the phone is good for elders and very beautifuly designed by King of mobiles NOKIA.Glad to know it is made in india***I wouldn't rate even 1 Star as the Phone is Pathetic Soud Quality is so Poor not able to Hear and Screen Resolution is is So Bad we may get into Sight Defection and the Return Policy is Not to the Satisfactorylevel as AMAZON says Electronic can't be Returned Back but How is this Possible without seeing the Product we have Brought and on Dissatisfaction on the requirements how can we live with it I suggest not to Buy Electronic Items through Online if this is the Policy***Very easy to use. Almost stock android. Android one programme and a smooth android experience. No hang and lag even though 1GB RAM. Always a favourite company ""THE NOKIA"".

In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market......

Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger.

Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now .

Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively.

The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile.

It's 1GB RAM is slow and steady and average touchscreen experience makes it easy for newbies. Poor battery standby and low quality screen resolution, considering they have thought of a functional Oreo OS variant but compromised on these hardware. Bare minimum internal storage of just 8GB, of which we get a little below 4GB free to use as the rest is taken by the system OS. All in all, a laboured purchase decision, given the compact screen size, price point and keeping other budget requirements in mind. I bought it for my mom so that she can use a Jio 4G SIM. While all other brands are moving to a somewhat eco-friendly all-glass body this handset is a polycarbonate one, at that. And, by the way, I have stuck a tempered glass protector as this handset's facia has no known protective shield.

This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5.

This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices.

The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone.

Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS).

Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now .

The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery.

One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery & also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data.

It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4.

The handset is locked onto the base of the phone so that the handset does not fall off the base when mounted on the wall.

I hate all this.Update: This product has some unique problem. It works on single line without any issue but if you want to use as a parallel connection then it creates problem -  either you don't get dial tone or it stops dial tone of your parallel line/instrument.

It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.***One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.***OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.***Good build.amazing battery life.

Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too.

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use..

We thought initially there is issue in line, we called our service provider, their engineer confirmed that issue is in cordless. We replaced with corded phone and did not find any voice disturbance.It is already more than return window. So we can't do much.Please refrain from buying this set.

Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5"" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ₹6500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***"

Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***"

This phone is everything smartphone should not have:1) heating problem2) phone lag3) hopelessly low battery life4) very bad touch sensorAs a customer, I can accept every issue except heating problem which is a health hazard for a customer. There have already been multiple instances of exploding of Samsung phone in the past and overheated battery raises a concern.On top of everything, comes the service of Amazon. So much for the 10-day replacement policy in case of any issue. I have been contacting Amazon for more than 10 days about the issue and they have not been able to identify the issue. Their app is not available in the jurisdiction (sent a screenshot to them and there was no response). A technician visit is scheduled for after 5 days a technician visits and he has not been able to replicate the issue because he didn't have the time for a 30 min call which is when the phone gets heated up. Now it is the responsibility of the customer to install a temperature app, monitor the temperature and the raise the issue only if the temperature rises above 45 degrees Celcius. They seriously hope the user to hold a device at 45 degrees. They should revoke the policy of replacement if they don't want to support the claims of the customer. This will at the very least vanish any false hope that the customer would have while buying the product.***useless phone, don’t buy this display camera is very bad 5k redmi phones are 1000 times better than this phone***PRODUCT IS OK***This is  a good phone than m20 because it has that amoled screen..

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

Bought it looking at the triple camera but it seems it is for display only. The camera is worst and takes you back to the phones 10 year old. No image stabilization, no clarity, no zoom. Camera is essential part of phones today and this phone is a waste with such a bad camera. I faced some issues with keyboard and typing as well. While typing it takes you back to home screen, may be some bugs.Weight is also on higher side.Phone is quite thick as well so no comparision with other premium modelsBest quality is battery life which can last upto 2 days with heavy usage.

Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps.

I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

Tha battery is not 1550... it is 1450.Apart from these two part phone looks good. I need to suggest 3 things.Display could have been larger by half inch. The battery could have been 1800 or 2000 mAh and the cam could have been 3 mp.Any body would pay 2200 for this.Otherwise phone is OK. Design is good plastics don't look cheap.With above 3 upgrades phone could have been a winner***Overall best value for money, if you are looking for a non android simple phone. Looks far more premium. I bought it to have the feeling of star trek communicator. Backlight of keyboard is poor though***This mobile is good for them who wants to use this phone only for calling purpose.  But,  it will be good if there is some more memory space  .***I bought this device as a gift. When I gifted it I got to know that inside the wrap the box was open and there was scratches all over the body of the phone. After installing the battery the phone never powered up. I couldn’t replace it as by the time it was sent back to me the replace or return period was over. Will never recommend this product to anyone***Gifted my dad this phone and it was a good item. Though not like smart phone, but good for old age people. Numbers are also big.***There was no battery in the phone.it just worked only wen u plug in and it went off as soon the plug is removed. When checked there was no battery installed. Want a new set.***Value for money good working condition***Very bad product.There is no availability of 2 G sim.4 G cannot works in this. Bad product***"

Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well. (8/10)=> SoftwareIt has Mi UI 9.5 with Android 8.1 which is very cool. There are many good features. Trust me It has excellent UI .i will give ( 9/10 )=> CameraIf you are looking for camera phone. Then it will good choice. front camera is good . and it has good rear camera too.

It has good ram management . (9/10)=> MY experienceWell I regret buying this phone, but it is good phone because of its performance and software. camera is good too.But there are better phone in this price range!Choose WISELY !***Have been using this phone for 10 days now. Following are the pros and cons which I have noticedPros:1. Great selfie camera2. Good performance- fast responses3. No heating issues4. Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***"

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

This mobile is good value for money.battery is too good. Performance is decent for a 5k mobile. And the overall performance is good. Camera is not that good. Fingerprint sensor works nicely. Build quality is decent. Speaker is too good. This is my honest review.***Nice but screen***The phone is worth the money. Good performance, the camera quality is average(which doesn't bother me as I don't use it much). The battery life is incredible on a normal use it stands two days. The heating problem written in other comments does not happen while using the phone , except while using it while charging , which is not suitable for any phone's life. The packaging was good and delivered before date. Altogether its worth the money at this price range***Very wrost mobile. From the 1st day itself its not working properly. Not even a proper support from amazon service. Smartcheck app shows that there is no problem in the phone but the performance of the phone is very wrost. Touch is not properly working. Hanging, heating, speakers are not even good. Very very worst mobile.

The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.***"

I was actually surprised by it's music player performance.

Good battery backup.

Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps.

I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing.

There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1.

The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

Look seems pretty i bought red in color and it look elegant. it seems like premium smartphone.2. when we start the phone it takes minimum time to start. it feels like butter3. initially the processor works good when there are factory applications installed in it.4. Screen touch is bitter less responsive but it is better for this budget.5. Color OS is producing good built up for apps but color response of screen is bitter annoying when use for longtime e.g.  gaming or watching movies6. rear 13+2 MP camera working nicely in day and pretty light condition. in low light photos are somwhat blurry ...but for this budget this camera setup is outstanding, and suffice the purpose. front 8 MP camera is good for daytime selfies and screen flash is also working good.7. Face unlock is very fast and responsive and working well in low light.8, battery is long lasting but takes 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. this is the only con of this that this does not have fast charging mode but again nothing could be better than this phone.9. speaker sound is impressive10, dual sim mode working fine.Now the small glimpse of cons- 1. battery charging time is longer about 3 to 4 hrs for full charge from nil battery.2. OS coloring is not that much good. i think OS upgrade will short out this problem.except everything is outstanding...you can go for this phone without a hassle if your budget is within 9k, No other phone can beat this phone in this budget.***"

The Wifi signal strength is very weak.

Once again, good for extra loudness.Nowadays, Android has support for most major Indian languages, so that's also a plus.I also considered the Moto E5 Plus, but decided this was good enough.

You can do nothing with the phone when on call. You cant even check contact list or type a note. Nothing. I didn't find this issue with a colleague who uses this same phone. I was either handed over a defective piece or Nokia is no more the TRUSTWORTHY Nokia.***Very slow and at this price company like Nokia should atleast give 2 to 3gb of RAM.

Build quality is decent. Speaker is too good. This is my honest review.***Nice but screen***The phone is worth the money. Good performance, the camera quality is average(which doesn't bother me as I don't use it much). The battery life is incredible on a normal use it stands two days. The heating problem written in other comments does not happen while using the phone , except while using it while charging , which is not suitable for any phone's life. The packaging was good and delivered before date. Altogether its worth the money at this price range***Very wrost mobile. From the 1st day itself its not working properly. Not even a proper support from amazon service. Smartcheck app shows that there is no problem in the phone but the performance of the phone is very wrost. Touch is not properly working. Hanging, heating, speakers are not even good. Very very worst mobile. Please don’t buy this***Mobile is too poor quality its getting too heated while on calling n while chargingI want to return it back***"

This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5. Affordable as compared to Pro Version6. Amoled Full HD7.Snapdragon 855 SoC***It is so buttery smooth and insanely fast that i don't have words to describe whole experience... Just buy it you won't regret... Its better than OnePlus 7 Pro.***it is getting heated and screen is blinking non stop***Phone stopped working after 2 days. Not switching on. Please don't buy. Also not able to return.***Oneplus, as always packs the pure raw power in their devices. Its slick, fast, smooth and much improved entertainment box now. It has stereo speakers but sadly no aux, along with that the saddest part is, there is no type c to aux dongle. Deducted two stars because of same charging speed as last year and aux missing.****Honest Review*Bought Oneplus 7 in the first sale.Delivered 2 days backUsing OnePlus for the first time. It is  just superb.Not easy to describe OnePlus 7 in a small review.Camera is fantastic.This is the first phone which is faster then the speed of my fingers :p33,000 is a handsome amount but i think this phone is value for money.If you are one who spend his good time using phone then this is best for you. Its processor saves time because now i am able to do work even more faster.Features you can easily check in product description.5/5 for camera.5/5 for processor.5/5 for shape.5/5 overall.***Well, much awaited OnePlus really stood up the wait we all did.I won't go for the pros and cons! I will go with the feel this phone has which it's competitors such as Asus, Redmi, etc doesn't at all.Yes, there are some quirks but still this is valuable smartphone your hard earned money can really buy.Your money will be on the right side with this OnePlus 7, if you're in doubt which phone to buy in 35k budget.. go with this one hands down, eyes closed. This will you that premium feel.Clean crisp display, loud stereo speakers, super fast phone, nicer camera, fastest storage, etc.Pro tip: Install GCam for OnePlus 7 and click pictures as good as pixel phones. Trust me. You'll love your OnePlus more for this. It will significantly improve your phone's camera quality at par with flagships costing 60k.***"

Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after ""is"" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only??

I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon.

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile.

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1.

The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

While typing it takes you back to home screen, may be some bugs.Weight is also on higher side.Phone is quite thick as well so no comparision with other premium modelsBest quality is battery life which can last upto 2 days with heavy usage.

Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after ""is"" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

This phone is everything smartphone should not have:1) heating problem2) phone lag3) hopelessly low battery life4) very bad touch sensorAs a customer, I can accept every issue except heating problem which is a health hazard for a customer. There have already been multiple instances of exploding of Samsung phone in the past and overheated battery raises a concern.On top of everything, comes the service of Amazon. So much for the 10-day replacement policy in case of any issue. I have been contacting Amazon for more than 10 days about the issue and they have not been able to identify the issue. Their app is not available in the jurisdiction (sent a screenshot to them and there was no response). A technician visit is scheduled for after 5 days a technician visits and he has not been able to replicate the issue because he didn't have the time for a 30 min call which is when the phone gets heated up. Now it is the responsibility of the customer to install a temperature app, monitor the temperature and the raise the issue only if the temperature rises above 45 degrees Celcius. They seriously hope the user to hold a device at 45 degrees. They should revoke the policy of replacement if they don't want to support the claims of the customer. This will at the very least vanish any false hope that the customer would have while buying the product.***useless phone, don’t buy this display camera is very bad 5k redmi phones are 1000 times better than this phone***PRODUCT IS OK***This is  a good phone than m20 because it has that amoled screen..

Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken.

No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

What I liked is good battery with fast charging, nice front camera for video call, rear camera is fine, included back cover and screen protector in box also earphones means not required to purchase extra things, android go means will be providing update for 2 years... Speaker also good, one more thing which I like is gestures like double tap wake up and when screen is off and you make 'V' its flash is lit...Only the main negative point is ram is 1gb that doesn't allow to run two apps simultaneously... I also would have preferred 2gb variant but when I purchased, its 2gb variant was not released in market...Overall well and good...Today when the representative took feedback on call and asked about rating, I told that will give 4 stars for which he didn't convinced for more and only replied to write a review...

It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).***Best basic mobile with front camera and front flash, and good battery life in this price, and mobile is easy to use, but I feel sound is low compared to other mobiles..***It’s a gift for my mom, as she is not tech savvy and is not into smart phones. This phone is perfect for normal use and is very light and cute one!***Very good phone with very good quality Loudspeaker & mic & earpiece quality with strong standard from Nokia!Buy it!***The sound quality is bad to say the least.  When I called Nokia Customer care they promised to replace the piece and assured of pick up in 24-48 hours.  gave me a complaint no. I have also sent a mail to their customer care.  Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *. Now it is totally confusing to lock keypad. Battery backup would have been little more, still it last lasts for 2 days with Avg. Calling and playing music files***"

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***"

But when I saw the charger it said ""made in china"". Still OK. Now I thought of charging the phone a bit.. just 5 minutes after setting the new phone. As soon as I connected the charger to the socket, there was a spark and shot circuit in the charger, phone was not connected. So go disappointed. I am not returning this phone as I have already gifted it. Not sure if Amazon seller would be able to send replacement for the charger alone. Amazon never replaced the product even after multiple conversations..***The phone at first look is an ice breaker at this price ...during the first year everything related to it I'm pressed me weather it is sound quality or features.....but as the first year ended the story took a horrible turn. My phone has now a lot of issues , it's charging speed has slowed down, it didn't charge at once,I have to reinsert the charging pin while charging as it stops charging after some times, it comes out of sleep after pressing the side button a lot of times,and even when I press the side key to lock it ,it makes an emergency number call automatically......etc....etc....And now it has revealed it's face after 1yr so I can't avail for warranty replacement.***Amazing Smartphone under 10k, Camera is mind blowing.Everything are working well.No Issues 👍👌***Highly NOT RECOMMENDEDWhile ordering I was like I'm ordering Indian make handset with patriotic feeling and expected the unexpected :(Pathetic phone, received defected peice, got it exchanged after so much hassle, again received faulty handset. If someone calls me other person can't hear me properly. They think I've put the on speaker and speaking from other room with phone in other room. So awful.***Whatever this phone might have been capable of has been completely ruined by the software on this phone and despite almost everybody calling it out to micromax, there is no hint of any improvement regarding the same.After almost an year using this phone, I would not recommend this or any other micromax phone for that matter. To what extent do we settle with this company for the sake of patriotism, atleast the Chinese are working hard and competing with apple, and here is micromax only interested in churning in money by reselling the fruit of Chinese hardwork. Great example of pathetic leadership and certainly not a company that shows any patriotism or deserves the patriotic support shown by Indians towards this company !***This is a really worst phone .This phone is arise ao many software problems .Like hanging,slow working apps..Touch will be loose with in a short period of time ..And lack of servicing centers ...Even small crash on phone also this phone unworthy for warranty ... Software update kavalante 300/-.at services centre.,such a big mistake in my daily usage..So plz beware of this phone***Better than Redmi Note 4... Using this phone since last 6 months..no problem at all.. Everything is good in this phone under the price range 10k... A better try from Micromax to get back into the market...***Got this phone delivered on 15th aug, using it for more than 15 hours now. Facing problem with battery drainage, it reduces like 20% with normal usage in less than an hour. By normal usage I mean even updating the contact details as it is new phone. Also when the phone is not in use i.e on standby it reduces 5-7% in an hours time.So 20% drainage in 1hr is really bad. Hence applying for Return.***"

I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike.

So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5"" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ₹6500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***"

Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide","I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.I have one issue with phone :My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...***First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone. Nice colour and Design. 6.5 inch screen makes a great viewing experience for movies and game's specialy PUBG😍😍. Super fast Charging. Full Charge in just 1.5 Hrs.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

After a discussion with my friend, I checked V11 Pro over POCO F1 as I'm an ardent Xiaomi Fan. The specs were amazing except the processor. However V11 pro handles the apps like a charm. I play Asphalt 9 often and the performance is always great.  Camera is decent. It makes me look too white and you never get the natural look. Selfie lovers are taken care of with several features and 25MP front camera.Low light capabilities are worst and the processing algorithm works worst  under few conditions. When digital zoomed, it smudge the faces and it was too worst in back lit conditions. HDR works decent.  Phone feels very light in hand and moving from 5.5 inch display to this I didn't have any issues. I love this display, however the display is on the warmer side and I had to change it in settings and I still feel it is warmer.  Regarding the software, the Funtouch OS is overdone and the updates are very rare. I am not sure about the update support in the future and update to Android 9. Few issues like, when you switch on wifi in the control centre,it goes to the WIFI settings everytime, the same applies to bluetooth. It is irritating when using other apps. Multitasking works only with very few apps.  Dedicated Game mode is amazing. Search feature in the settings is not there which is disappointing.  The only downside of the mobile is the Operating System.  Quick charge is amazing and it charges the 3400mAh battery in around 90 to 100 minutes. It easily stands for a day with moderate usage. Heavy usage may take you around 8 to 9 hours to dry the battery.  Amazing piece of hardware with Super AMOLED display which looks great and the display is almost bezel-less.The graphics around the fingerprint scanner is amazing.Face ID works better and in display fingerprint scanner is sometimes a hit or miss. I rely much on the Face ID which works even in darker conditions.  Package has an earphone which is a nice touch comparing other brands who don't care about that.  I would definitely recommend this mobile.Hits :  Amazing Display  Face ID  PerformanceMiss:  Terrible Operating System  Fingerprint scannerI would recommend this phone for the price especially for the display.***I never liked Vivo or Oppo. I was always a fan of Xiomi. Vivo V11 Pro was not my first choice. I wanted to buy Real Me 2 Pro. With all offers this phone was around 18K same price as 8GB, 128 GB model of Real me Pro. I just hated the flash sales.My requirement was  Good Screen, Nice Photos, Music and I do not care much about playing games.My experiences after using 10 daysPros:-1.Superb display it is a treat to watch the screen. Nearly Bezel Less and the water drop notch you would hardly notice while watching videos.2.Camera Performance is good, but in an effort to make me look white it over smudges in portrait shots other wise camera performance is decent on Front and Back3.Super light weight, slips from hand easily.4. I do not play games for me battery lasts almost whole day, but the charge is super fast, almost 1 to 2 percentage for every minute. So even I am in low battery, it charges in no time.5. Face unlock is super fast even at night and in dark. You will never use finger print scanner.Cons:-1. I always used stock android or MIUI. Funtouch OS is a mess, but since we do not do any setting changes regularly, it is ok.2. Updates are hopeless, this is October, but still phone runs on August Security Patch. I would recommend this phone only if you are getting it for around 18K or less else it is not worth it.***Worst part about the phone1. Funtouch version of Android- compulsory u have to use funtouch. U can. Not  switch to pure Android launcher- u can not arrange the apps alphabetically.- the easy access button has limited use- basic pull down quick access not availableDon't buy if u have been using this phone***Purchased with Good Hopes, But..1.Screen lock is not working, If you keep Finger for 4-5 second Screen will unlock By Luck2. Call Drop is Common Problem, Anytime during call Call Sensor stopped working.3.Face Unlock is Difficult to Open, Always you have to Draw pattern For Unlocking Device5.Phone Starts Hanging6.Picture Quality is So So, You cant compare this Device with One Plus any series. Previously i was Oneplus3 user. I am feeling Bad ,why i decided to purchase this by exchanging my Op36. ""Battery"" Dash Charging Is Only the Tag line to Sell device. It will take around 1.50-2.30 hour to charge device.7.Phone Heating is Normal Problem.8.Screen and Back Cover Catch dirt and finger prints. You have to keep one Tissue always for wiping the Dirt.9.Sound Quality is Good, Video Quality is Good10.Call voice is Ok Ok.. Not so Clear, Background Noice Is more disturbing.""Purchase this Device at Your Own Risk""Because Resell Value is Tooo Low.***Picture quality as u can see awesome!!!!***Unboxed found new handset, started phone and its getting hang, restarting, not starting , really upset . Can’t use the phone . First time shifted to android and was really upset to see a new phone having problem. Requested for replacement/ refund . Amazon mentioned technician will rectify issue and let me know till than I have to wait. Better to buy offline use. Waste of moneyI brought this phone after all positive reviews here and sad that I am giving one star because of its poor performance/ actually no performing all***I WAS USING I PHONES FROM LAST 7 YEARS. I WAS NOT AT ALL ATTRACTED IN ANY ANDROID PHONE IN LAST 7 YEARS, BUT AFTER 7 YEARS I HAVE DECIDED TO GO FOR ANDROID AGAIN. AND MARK MY WORDS THIS VIVO V11 PRO IS AMAZING, SUPERB, MIND BLOWING CELL PHONE. SCREEN IS SO GOOD AND VIBRANT, BATTERY LIFE IS TOO GOOD AND THE BEST PART IS CAMERA SPECIALLY FRONT CAMERA WHICH IS 25MP IS THE BEST FRONT FACING CAMERA I HAVE EVER SEEN. SO DONT HASITATE BUY THIS PHONE.***"

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1.

Lots of things wrong with the instrument I got. But most annoying things were1. Pressing the receiver knob does not cut the call or dial tone and I can only make one call ever. I would need to disconnect and reconnect the wire to make another call.2. Speaker functionality was inconsistent. Sometimes it would turn up and sometimes it would not.Overall, not quality checked before it was sent. Amazon does not seem to care about the quality of the products people order. Waste of time for me. I could have easily bought it in a physical store instead of relying on the crappy stuff these guys deliver.***Overall a decent product and gives value for money. The display is bit tricky since its not visible at all angles.  Have to be viewed at a particular angle to see the numbers clearly even when back-lit. Have decent enough features.  Speaker clarity is also good. One thing is that once you replace the batteries all the stores numbers in speed dial will be erased.  You have to feed it in again.***Exactly a month after the purchase, the phone stops ringing. Though the speaker functions as it should be, the buzzer stopped working and now we are left with a phone that doesnot give a ring for an incoming call.So my advice to prospective buyers is , avoid these kinds of fancy ones and better stick to the traditional models.***Good phone for taking conf calls on speaker which is why I bought this phone.***"

But since Nokia has handed over its  handset production  to HMD global the quality of Nokia products especially feature phones have declined. This product Nokia 150 disappoints in every aspect like battery backup (3-4 days max in standby and 2 days if you do some calling and  play music ),camera quality(even  jiophone has better quality ,Nokia 150 will capture ghost out of you) and every thing for which i purchased it. At same or cheaper price other companies are offering better features like inbuilt call recorder , 3000mah battery with power bank feature. what is use of durability when performance is poor. I do not recommend it for basic phone user. Go for Samsung if you are using 2G network or better go for jiophone (which i have tried and tested).Regarding the  seller i.e Appario retail, they didn't mention any of the two IMEI Numbers without  which warranty can't be claimed instead they have mentioned  one IMEI number in 'order summary' where it has been clearly written that it can not be presented as an invoice.

There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.***Good build.amazing battery life.

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good.

The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering ""mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money"". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours).

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

Look seems pretty i bought red in color and it look elegant. it seems like premium smartphone.2. when we start the phone it takes minimum time to start. it feels like butter3. initially the processor works good when there are factory applications installed in it.4. Screen touch is bitter less responsive but it is better for this budget.5. Color OS is producing good built up for apps but color response of screen is bitter annoying when use for longtime e.g.  gaming or watching movies6. rear 13+2 MP camera working nicely in day and pretty light condition. in low light photos are somwhat blurry ...but for this budget this camera setup is outstanding, and suffice the purpose. front 8 MP camera is good for daytime selfies and screen flash is also working good.7. Face unlock is very fast and responsive and working well in low light.8, battery is long lasting but takes 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. this is the only con of this that this does not have fast charging mode but again nothing could be better than this phone.9. speaker sound is impressive10, dual sim mode working fine.Now the small glimpse of cons- 1. battery charging time is longer about 3 to 4 hrs for full charge from nil battery.2. OS coloring is not that much good. i think OS upgrade will short out this problem.except everything is outstanding...you can go for this phone without a hassle if your budget is within 9k, No other phone can beat this phone in this budget.***"
